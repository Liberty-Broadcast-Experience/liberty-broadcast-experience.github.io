## Assignments
These are just my preferences for how the cameras are ran.

For more information on how to run the camera itself, expand the "more information" menu at the bottom of each section to access more detailed information.

### General Notes
- **Utilize your resources.** If you're still feeling unsure about what to do after the camera meeting, watch the [camera training videos](/portal/video/camera/introduction/), or ask someone near you.
- **Clean > Creative.** Get the fundamentals down first—zoom, focus, composition, watching tally. Then get creative.
- **Worship through your work.** Don't overthink it. Just let God work through you.
- **Don't be afraid of failure.** Excellence has an energy.

### Cameras 1-4: Big builds
#### Worship

- **Maintain proper framing.** Do not go tighter than a **bust shot** or looser than **head-to-toe (HTT)**.
	- Use your box lens, and avoid wide shots. Wide coverage is already provided by other cameras.

- **Keep movement during worship.** Always be subtly zooming in or out, *never keep your shot static*. Smoothly transition between zooming in and out.

- **Stay live on IMAG when needed.** You may stay live for an extended amount of time in the room while we are cutting on the broadcast. Feel free to change zoom direction as long as it’s smooth.
- **Match the energy of the song.** Feel the rhythm and intensity of the moment and adjust your movement accordingly.


Some additional considerations for when you're not shooting lead:

- **Capture background elements.** Focus on background vocalists (BGVs) or the crowd.

- **Use situational judgment.** Read the scene and adjust accordingly. If the crowd doesn't seem into it, don't shoot them.

- **Keep it even.** Check program & multiview returns. If there aren’t many males on camera, shoot females and vice versa. This helps break up the shots a bit.

  

#### Speaking
- Keep your shot static, but follow the speaker as they move across the stage.
- Follow default framing (unless told otherwise).

	- **Cameras 1 & 3**: Bust shot

	- **Cameras 2 & 4**: Head-to-toe (HTT)

I'd recommend reading through both of these articles. As a big build operator, **you will need information from both of these videos.**

### Camera 5: Dolly
#### Worship
- **Prioritize instruments.** Aim for 80% instruments, 20% vocals in your shots.  
- **Electric Guitar.** I love tight, sweeping shots of electric guitarists.  
- **Keys.** Pay attention to **song intros, interludes, and outros** for key moments.  

#### Message
- **Vary your shots during the message.** Alternate between HTT and wide shots that showcase the Liberty sign in the background.

### Camera 6: Jib
- **Be prepared for the "big".** Always be ready to sweep in at every big moment in the song.  
- **Be ready for transition.** Always have a smooth transition shot at the beginning and end of every element in the show.

### Camera 8: Handheld
#### Worship
- **Focus on instruments.** Shoot 95% instruments, 5% everything else—some crowd shots are okay.  
    - Prioritize drums, bass, and electric guitar.  
- **Minimize unnecessary movement.** Find 2-3 solid positions and stick to them to reduce repositioning time.  

#### Message
- Framing considerations:  
  - If the program feed is on **HTT**, shoot a **bust shot**.  
  - If the program feed is on **bust shot**, shoot **HTT**.  
  - In some cases, I may have you shoot crowd instead.

### Camera 9: High Wide
- **Act like you're always live.** This shot is used in the edit.  
- **Maintain proper headroom and framing.** The LED wall should always be at the top of your frame.  
- **Stay wide.** Do not go tight—at all!  
- **Control speed and pacing.** Keep movements smooth and consistent throughout the song.  
- **Use pushes and pulls.** Don’t be afraid to add movement for a more dynamic shot.  
- **Be prepared for the "big".** Always be ready to have a move at every big moment in the song.    
- **Broadcast only.** This camera will never be shown on the screens, only in the broadcast.
