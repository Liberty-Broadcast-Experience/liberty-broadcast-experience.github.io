## Assignments
#### Please note...
These are just my preferences for how the cameras are ran.

For more information on how to run the camera itself, expand the "more information" menu at the bottom of each section to access more detailed information.
### Cameras 1-4: Big builds
- If you are lead, don’t go tighter than a bust shot, or looser than a HTT
- If you are lead, you may stay live on IMAG for an extended amount of time. Don’t be afraid to ease from a push to a pull, or a pull to a push. I’m totally ok with changing zoom directions as long as it’s smooth.
- Feel the energy of the song.
- If you are not lead, shoot BGVs or crowd- use your judgment
- Check returns, if there is not many males on camera, shoot female and vice versa
- During the message or any speaking, 1 & 3 are a bust shot, 2 & 4 are HTT
- Stay tight, use your lens. I have more than enough of wide room coverage from 5/6/7/9

I'd recommend reading through both of these articles. As a big build operator, you will need information from both of these videos.

### Camera 5: Dolly
- 80% instruments, 20% vocals
- I love tight sweeping electric shots
- Keep an ear out for keys- song intros/interludes/outros
- During the message, vary between HTT, and wide shot showing off LU sign

### Camera 8: Handheld
- 95% instruments, 5% everything else
    - I don't mind some crowd thrown in
- You are my main instrument coverage
- Drums, bass, electric.
- Find your 2-3 positions that work and stay there to cut down on movement time
- During the message, shoot speaker. Watch your program return. If I’m on a HTT, shoot a bust shot. If I’m on a bust shot, shoot a HTT
    - In some instances I may have you shoot crowd

### Camera 9: High Wide
- Act like you're always live. We use this in the edit.
- Proper headroom and framing: LED wall should be at the top of your frame
- Don’t go tight, at all!
- Proper speed and pacing throughout the song
- Don’t be afraid to utilize pushes and pulls for more movement
- Be ready at every “big” moment for a shot
- You’ll be on the broadcast only, you’ll never be on the screens.
