The role of a supporting camera might seem minor, but it is crucial to the overall production. These cameras provide coverage that the primary centerline camera cannot capture, making the final production more dynamic and visually engaging.

## Capturing background vocalists

While the centerline camera focuses on the lead vocalist, the supporting camera should primarily capture background vocalists (BGVs). The goal is to provide complementary shots rather than duplicating the centerline cameraâ€™s framing.

- If the centerline camera is focused on the lead vocalist, the supporting camera should capture a background vocalist of the opposite gender or with a different framing.  
- The director will prioritize the lead vocalist, so background vocalists should be framed in a way that complements the main shot rather than competing with it.  
- Always be aware of what is live to avoid capturing redundant shots.  

## Covering speakers

For speaking segments, the task is simple: follow the speaker. 

- In shows with an in-the-round setup, the director will specify which angles should be tight and which should be wide, capturing the full figure.  
- On traditional stages, secondary cameras typically provide a full-body shot while the centerline camera offers a tighter shot.  

## Using foreground elements

Foreground elements can add depth and interest to a shot. If the camera plot allows for it, use elements like the crowd or stage props to create more dynamic framing.

- Including the crowd in the frame helps the online audience feel like they are part of the event.  
- A well-composed shot includes foreground, middle ground, and background for a more visually engaging image.  

## Teamwork between secondary cameras

An effective secondary camera operator actively watches their return feed and adapts their shot based on what is already being covered. For example:

- If cameras one and three are covering background vocalists, camera four might focus on the acoustic guitarist, and camera two might capture the keyboardist.  
- When camera two sees that another camera has already switched to the keyboardist, they should smoothly transition to another subject, such as a background vocalist.  
- This awareness ensures a variety of shots and helps the director seamlessly cut between different perspectives.  

The job of a secondary camera operator is to supplement the centerline camera and provide the director with more shot variety. This improves the overall quality of the production and ensures a more engaging viewing experience.
