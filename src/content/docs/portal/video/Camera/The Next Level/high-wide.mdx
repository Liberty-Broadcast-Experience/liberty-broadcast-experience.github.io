## Introduction
While it may seem like an unimportant position, the high wide camera is highly beneficial to the show as a whole.

The goal of the high wide camera is to show off the room that the event is in. It allows the viewer at home to take in the scale of the room, and what it feels like to be there in person.

Additionally, this camera is a valuable tool for our editors when editing Convocation and Campus Community, as it is typically used to correct mistakes made during the show.

This is a great chance to put everything into practice that has been taught in *The Next Level*, our camera training series. **Take this time to get used to hearing the director, seeing tally, and getting comfortable with your camera.** This will set you up well for success if you get the opportunity to run a different camera.

## Objectives
1. **Show off the room.** Stay wide, don't zoom in too tight.
2. **Be slow, predictable, and steady.** Run the camera as if you were a sloth.
3. **Always keep the camera moving.** It should be able to be cut to at any time during the show, or during the edit.

## Operation Notes
- Some high wide cameras will have a dolly track. It is recommended to not move the camera on the track until you are comfortable with the camera. Meaning, operate the camera as if it were just on a tripod.
- The zoom controller is finnicky. You will have to practice zooming smoothly.

## Examples
### Locator Shot
We display a locator on the broadcast in order to show the viewer where we are. Below is an example of this shot, which is typically taken from the high-wide camera.

### B-Stage Framing
Here is a good example of B-Stage framing.

### Low Energy Worship
Moving nice and slow, matching the pace of the song.

### High Energy Worship
Moving pretty quick, matching the pace of the song. Pay careful attention to how the operator is using the dolly and zoom to create energy.

### Message
Similar in speed to low-energy worship. Enough movement to be able to tell the camera is moving, but not too much movement that it appears jarring.
