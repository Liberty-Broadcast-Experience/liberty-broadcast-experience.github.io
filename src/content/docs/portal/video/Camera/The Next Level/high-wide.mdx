## Introduction
While it may seem like an unimportant position, the high wide camera is highly beneficial to the show as a whole.

The goal of the high wide camera is to show off the room that the event is in. It allows the viewer at home to take in the scale of the room, and what it feels like to be there in person.

This is a great chance to put everything into practice that has been taught in *The Next Level*, our camera training series. Take this time to get used to hearing the director, seeing tally, and getting comfortable with your camera. This will set you up well for success if you get the opportunity to run a different camera.

## Objectives
- Stay wide, don't zoom in too tight
- Run the camera like a sloth. Your goal is to be **slow, predictable, and steady.**
- Always keep the camera moving. It should be able to be cut to at any time during the show.
    - This camera is used often when we go to edit the show afterwards.

## Operation Notes
- Some high wide cameras will have a dolly track. It is recommended to not move the camera on the track until you are comfortable with the camera. Meaning, operate the camera as if it were just on a tripod.
- The zoom controller is finnicky. You will have to practice zooming smoothly.
