This training covers tips and techniques for operating a centerline camera. Topics include framing, especially for lead vocalists and speakers, tripod drag, stabilizer settings, and practical application. 

The centerline camera is live for most of the show. It serves as a bail shot, meaning the director can cut to it at any moment. Because of this, strong and consistent framing is essential.

## Framing for speakers

When following a speaker, aim for a waist-up shot. If they move frequently, loosen the framing slightly to allow movement within the frame. Always provide lead room in the direction they are walking to prevent them from appearing too close to the edge or walking out of the frame entirely.

Maintaining proper headroom is also important. If the head is too low in the frame, it risks being cut off. If it's too high, the framing looks unbalanced. A good way to maintain consistency is by enabling safe areas on the viewfinder and setting it to around 90%. Keeping the speaker’s head near that line ensures proper framing throughout.

## Keeping focus sharp

Since the centerline camera captures the most critical shot of the speaker, sharp focus is a requirement. There are various methods to keep focus sharp: peaking, VF Detail, and focus numbers. There is not a right or wrong method, each option will work. It is up to you, the camera operator, to discover what will work best for you.

Every camera operator has a different method that works for them, keeping the shot in focus is what matters.

## Tripod drag and stabilizer settings

All six cameras have tilt and pan drag controls, and the big builds include a stabilizer. These settings affect how smoothly the camera moves.

- Drag settings are a personal preference, but the goal is to avoid sudden stops and jerky movements. Too much drag makes fine adjustments difficult, while too little drag can cause overshooting.  
- The stabilizer has two strength levels: standard and high. Standard is recommended for most situations. High stabilizer strength causes abrupt stops and is only useful when limiting movement entirely, such as for a subject who remains almost completely still.  
- There are also two stabilization modes: vertical and horizontal plus vertical. Vertical mode stabilizes only the vertical axis, while horizontal plus vertical stabilizes both. The second mode should only be used if keeping the camera still is proving difficult, as it restricts smooth movement.  

## Practical examples

### Maintaining framing in a chaotic environment

In a fast-paced environment, such as a spontaneous moment during a live event, strong camera work is crucial. A good centerline operator maintains consistent framing, focus, and stability, even as the crowd and lighting become chaotic. 

For example, during an energetic segment, a well-trained camera operator follows the subject steadily, ensuring that the director has a reliable shot at any moment. The key takeaway is to remain focused, maintain smooth movement, and avoid getting carried away by the energy of the scene.

### Losing the lead

A common mistake in centerline operation is losing track of the lead. If a lead singer or speaker suddenly moves and walks out of the frame, it creates a gap in coverage. The operator must remain focused, anticipating movements and making necessary adjustments in real time to keep the subject framed.

### Creating energy in slower songs

Even in a slow song, camera movement is still important. A subtle, slow push into the lead vocalist creates visual energy, making the shot more engaging for the audience. This movement may seem small, but it makes a significant difference in drawing the viewer into the performance.

### Lack of movement

Conversely, failing to move the camera can make a shot feel static and disengaging. If an operator keeps the same framing for an entire song without any movement, the energy of the shot is lost. While there are rare cases where this may be necessary, maintaining slight motion is generally preferable for a more dynamic and engaging broadcast.

## Final thoughts

Running the centerline camera requires precision, consistency, and an awareness of the overall show. The goal is to maintain strong framing, keep focus sharp, and use subtle movements to enhance the shot’s energy. With practice, these techniques will become second nature.
