By now, you've watched all the training videos and become familiar with the expectations of a camera operator. This section will focus on key operational techniques that apply to any camera and provide final insights on teamwork, creativity, and improving your craft.

## Essential Terminology

Understanding these terms will help you operate efficiently and communicate clearly with the production team.

| Term               | Definition |
|--------------------|------------|
| Pull In on Air    | Zoom out while live. |
| Push In on Air    | Zoom in while live. |
| Snap In and Out   | A quick zoom in or out that is off air. |
| Pan              | Moving the lens horizontally, left or right. |
| Tilt             | Moving the lens vertically, up or down. |
| Tight Shot       | Framing from the chest to just above the head, prioritizing the eyes in the top third of the frame. |
| Waist Up         | Medium shot, framing from the waist to just above the head. |
| Knee Up          | Framing from the knees to just above the head. |
| Head to Toe      | Framing from just below the feet to above the head. |
| Big Wide         | The widest the lens can zoom out. |
| Cover Shot       | A shot that includes all the action on stage. |
| Two Shot         | A shot with two people in the frame. |
| Clean Shot       | A shot where the subject is alone in the frame. |
| Dirty Shot       | A shot where another person or an object is in the frame with the subject. |
| Lead Room        | Space in the frame in front of the subject. Give lead room opposite to the direction they are looking or moving. |
| Sticks           | Another name for a tripod. |
| Rack Focus       | Adjusting focus either forward or away from you. |
| Electric         | Short for electric guitar. Make sure you know the difference between electric guitar and bass guitar. |
| Acoustic         | Short for acoustic guitar. |

| Position Numbers | Numbers assigned to vocalists based on their stage position, starting from left to right. |
| AD (Assistant Director) | The role of the assistant director is to call out moments that are going to happen in the show to help camera operators and the director prepare. |
| Returns         | A feature that allows you to see either the program feed or the multi-view on your viewfinder. Use this to see what the other cameras are capturing and frame your shot accordingly. |

## Composition and Creativity

A camera is just a toolâ€”its impact comes from how the operator uses it. Strong composition creates more engaging shots. Keep these principles in mind:

- Always have a clear subject.  
- Use depth by layering foreground, middle ground, and background.  
- Follow the rule of thirds to frame subjects effectively.  

Being creative with a camera depends on the situation. Some moments call for dynamic framing, while others require simplicity. Match the energy of the moment with the appropriate shot style.

## Operating to the Music

Music-driven productions require camera movements that complement the pace of the song.

- Pushes and pulls are natural movements that work well across most camera types.  
- A centerline camera can add movement by subtly rocking back and forth with the artist instead of zooming.  
- For handheld cameras, drawing small figure-eight motions with the viewfinder crosshairs can create smooth, organic movement.  

Moving cameras like Steadicam and dolly offer even more ways to enhance energy, but movement should always be intentional.

## Intentional Camera Moves

Every movement should have a clear goal.

- Avoid unnecessary zooms or focus adjustments unless they reveal something meaningful.  
- Lead room can be used creatively by framing subjects in unexpected ways.  
- Handheld cameras have lens extenders that create a ghosting effect when partially engaged. This can be a stylized effect when used sparingly.  
- A handheld camera placed on a wheeled tripod can mimic a dolly shot, but operators should be cautious of cables or floor irregularities.  
- Racking focus during a dissolve can create a dreamy transition effect, but should be used sparingly to avoid an outdated look.  
- Strong backlighting and lens flares can be used artistically to highlight subjects.  
- The LED wall can be incorporated into shots, either by framing lyrics with a vocalist or transitioning smoothly from a full-screen slide.  

## Handling Q&A Sessions

Q&A sessions require a different approach than live performances. The camera plot will determine each camera's role.

- Some cameras are responsible for cross-shooting guests. A clean shot is preferred unless the director requests a different framing.  
- A handheld camera on wheels should maneuver for clean shots where needed.  
- The centerline camera typically serves as a cover shot, especially in smaller venues.  
- Jib cameras are important for post-production edits, ensuring clean and smooth coverage.  
- A roaming RF camera is primarily used for crowd shots and over-the-shoulder angles, which are valuable for post-editing even if not taken live.  

During Q&A moments, creativity is less important than maintaining clean, steady shots. The goal is clear visual coverage rather than artistic framing.

## Teamwork and Professionalism

A great production is the result of a well-coordinated team. Keep these points in mind:

- Be aware of where other cameras are positioned to avoid appearing in their shots.  
- Work together with handheld operators and adjust positioning as needed.  
- Review previous shows to identify areas for improvement.  
- Accept feedback and offer constructive criticism to others.  

## Final Thoughts

At Campus Production, the goal is more than just technical excellence. Whether running a camera, directing, or operating a fader, the work is ultimately about contributing to a meaningful experience. Some days, that will feel more natural than others, but maintaining an attitude of service and intentionality can make all the difference.

Through this course, you have gained a deeper understanding of camera operation and production teamwork. Continued practice and a willingness to learn will take these skills to the next level.
