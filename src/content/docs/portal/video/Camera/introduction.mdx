# Welcome to the Camera Training Series!

Welcome to this camera training series, designed to help you become a better camera operator. Whether you have years of experience or are just starting out, this course will provide valuable insights to enhance your skills.

This training is not meant to be a one-time session. In addition to this course, we encourage you to participate in hands-on, in-person training sessions. Taking full advantage of these opportunities will help you develop a deeper understanding of the equipment and techniques needed to excel in your role at Campus Production.

## Maximizing Your Gear’s Potential

Here at Liberty, we have access to incredible camera equipment, but technology alone isn’t enough. A camera is only as effective as the operator behind it. That’s why our focus is on ensuring that you understand every aspect of your gear and how to use it to its fullest potential.

## What You’ll Learn

This training will cover all types of cameras and their unique functions, including:

- Handheld cameras
- Big builds
- Small builds

We will dive into the technical details of each camera, from macro to micro levels, ensuring you have a solid foundation in camera operation. Additionally, we’ll explore essential topics such as:

- Shot composition
- Camera returns
- Utilizing camera features for the best visual output

By the end of this course, you’ll have a clear understanding of the shots you should aim for and how to make the most of each camera’s capabilities.

## The Importance of Teamwork

While mastering your camera skills is crucial, being part of a team is just as important. A well-coordinated team creates a stronger and more dynamic production than any individual effort alone. As a new team member, your contributions will enhance the overall success of our broadcasts.

## Welcome to the Team!

We’re thrilled to have you on board and excited for an amazing season of productions. Get ready to learn, grow, and collaborate as we create high-quality broadcasts together.
