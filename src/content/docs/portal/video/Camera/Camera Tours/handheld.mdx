Let's begin with a camera tour. This session will guide you through the different components of a handheld build, pointing out essential switches, buttons, and features. This guide is meant as a reference to help you get comfortable with the camera. The more you use it, the more familiar you’ll become.

## Power and Video Signal

At the back of the camera, power is provided through an optical con input using an optical con cable. To detach the cable:

- Pull back on the ring to free the cap.  
- Remove the cap from the camera port.  
- Align the line on the cable with the groove in the port.  
- Always cap the cables when not in use.  

This cable supplies both power and video signal. The camera both receives signals from the control room and sends signals back. While we won’t cover the entire signal flow process, just know that one cable handles both power and video.

## Camera Returns

On the side and back of the camera, there is a row of dials. Here are a few important ones:

- Return shows video signals coming to the camera.  
- The camera has four returns, but for most Campus Community, Convocation, or smaller events, only two are used: video return one and return two.  
- If you don’t see anything in return two, verify that your switch is correctly set to return two, as this is a common issue.

## Intercom Settings

- Intercom volume and intercom switch are key settings.  
- The switch has three modes: OFF, PROD, and ENG.  
- For communication, set it to PROD to talk with other camera operators and the control room director.  
- The switch latches, meaning it stays in place when activated. Always switch it back to OFF when you are done talking to avoid distracting background noise.

The last knob on this side adjusts program volume.

## Power Switch

One of the most important switches is the power switch, which has three settings:  

- CCU – Used when the camera is connected via cable (this is the most common setting).  
- OFF – Turns the camera off.  
- EXT – Used when running on battery power or an external power source (rarely used).  

When using CCU, switch to CCU and wait a few seconds for the camera to boot up.

## Additional Camera Ports

- DC power port – Rarely used, but available.  
- Intercom port – Used to connect your headset.  
- SDI I/O ports – Occasionally, you will need to connect an SDI cable from the control room.  

## Assignable Buttons and Key Switches

On the side of the camera, several buttons and switches allow customization:

- Assignable buttons (Assign 1, 2, and 3) can be configured in the menu settings.  
  - Most operators assign Assign 1 to Return 1 and Assign 2 to Return 2.  
  - You can customize these settings based on your preference.  

- Status switch:  
  - Hold up to check your Optical Con levels on the viewfinder.  
  - If your bars are not full, you may have an issue and should contact the tech manager or engineer.  

- Menu/Display/Off switch:  
  - Display mode shows all information on the viewfinder (recommended).  
  - Off removes all on-screen information.  
  - Menu engages the settings menu (covered in a later session).  

## Lens and Focus Controls

At the front of the camera, we have the lens system:

- Lens mount allows attachment and removal of the lens using a locking lever.  
- Extender switch engages a 2x extender, doubling the focal length.  
- Zoom, iris, and focus rings:  
  - Zoom is controlled by the rocker switch.  
  - Focus is manual and adjusted using the focus barrel.  
  - Zoom rocker is on the servo grip and can be detached if necessary.  

### Additional Controls on the Zoom Rocker

- Auto/Manual Iris switch:  
  - Auto Iris allows the control room shader to adjust your camera settings remotely.  
- Return 1 button:  
  - This button can be reassigned, but is usually kept as Return 1.  
- VTR button:  
  - Can also be reassigned, but is commonly set for Intercom or Return 2.  

Other controls include:

- Zoom speed adjustment – Modifies the zoom speed.  
- Back focus knob – Located on the right side of the lens (covered more in in-person training).  

## Viewfinder Adjustments

The viewfinder allows you to fine-tune your image for better clarity:

- Adjustable position lock lets you move it for comfort.  
- Some viewfinders are black and white, while newer models offer color options.  
- Functionality is generally the same across different viewfinder models.  

This concludes the handheld camera tour. Next, we will explore the small build configuration.
