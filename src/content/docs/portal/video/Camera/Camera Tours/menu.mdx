This is a quick overview of the FB80 menu system. It will not cover every detail but will highlight some key settings to keep in mind.

## Accessing the menu

The menu system is accessed using the lever at the bottom of the camera. 

- Flipping the lever down enables the menu.  
- Flipping it to the middle turns off both the menu and the display.  
- Flipping it up to display mode restores the standard view.  

Once the menu is open, navigation is done using the dial in front. 

- Rotating the dial cycles through the menu pages.  
- Pressing the dial selects an option and enters a submenu.  

## Viewfinder settings

By default, no indicators are enabled on the viewfinder. Some useful indicators include focus numbers and zoom numbers, which help when following speakers. To enable these:

- Open the menu.  
- Navigate to page 4.  
- Select zoom and change the setting to on.  
- Do the same for focus.  
- Return to the display, and the zoom and focus numbers will now be visible.  

As focus or zoom adjustments are made, these numbers will update in real time.

## Adding a cursor

A cursor is a box that can be positioned anywhere on the screen. It is useful for framing graphics that will remain visible for extended periods, such as lyrics in a song. 

To enable and adjust the cursor:

- Open the menu.  
- Navigate to page 7.  
- Select enable cursor.  
- Adjust the horizontal and vertical position to place the box where needed.  
- Adjust the width and height to resize the box as needed.  
- Return to the display to see the cursor in place.  

## Assignable buttons

The camera has three assignable buttons that can be customized. These settings can be found in pages 9 and 10 of the menu.

- Page 9 contains settings for the assignable buttons on the camera.  
- Page 10 contains settings for the servo buttons on the lens, which generally do not need to be adjusted.  

By default, the buttons are set as follows:  

- Assignable 1: Return 1  
- Assignable 2: Return 2  
- Assignable 3: PROD (intercom communication)  

If changes are needed:

- Open the menu.  
- Navigate to the assignable button page.  
- Select a button and choose from a variety of available functions.  

These settings are typically adjusted based on operator preference.

## Intercom settings

If intercom issues arise, there are a few settings that may need to be checked. 

- Pages 12 and 13 of the menu contain intercom settings.  
- Navigate to page 13 to check how intercom audio is received.  
- The intercom receive setting should be set to mix, meaning the intercom audio will come through both ears in mono.  

If the intercom is set to separate, program audio and intercom audio can be split between left and right ears. This can be useful when working with an AD, but it may cause confusion if someone expects mono audio.

Another setting to check is PROD:

- If PROD is set to both, intercom audio will come through both ears.  
- If it is set to left or right, audio will only be heard in that ear.  

If a headset is picked up and intercom is not working, checking these settings may help troubleshoot the issue. If any changes are made, they can always be reset to mix and both.

## Final notes

This was a brief overview covering some key settings in the FB80 menu system. As more experience is gained with the camera, additional settings may become useful. Hands-on practice will help in becoming more comfortable with navigating and adjusting the menu.
