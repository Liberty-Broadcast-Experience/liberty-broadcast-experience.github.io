Welcome back! As a refresher, we will be simulating pulling in content for Convocation and Campus Community.

For each show, you will receive the **run of show** and **content folder**. Your job is to import all relevant items, as if it were a real show.

Feel free to consult the [Content Operator Training Guide](http://liberty-broadcast-experience.github.io/portal/video/control-room/content-operator/) for assistance.

Additionally, we'd like to remind you that you are able to download ProPresenter **for free** to learn the software outside of the control room. You can download it [by clicking here](https://www.renewedvision.com/propresenter/download).
