<Steps>

1. **Put 4 channels of tone on PGM.**
2. **Dial into TX number** using the TIFF so the TD can listen on their SmartPanel.
3. **Introduce self and game.**

    > "Hi, I'm Mike with the 4pm Liberty vs. Duke Men's Lacrosse game."
4. **Ask for an audio check.**

    > "Can we check audio first, before I pass you to our TD?"

5. **Complete audio check.**

    Mute your first channel of tone.
         > "One's away."

    Wait for confirmation, then unmute your first channel and mute your second channel of tone.
