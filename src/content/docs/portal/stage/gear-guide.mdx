This is a guide to our most common gear and cases to help you easily find what you need.

## Case Sizes
Cases come in all shapes and sizes. Many are named by how they fit in a truck.

- A half-by case is half the width of a truck long.
- A quarter-by is a quarter of the truck width.
- A caddy is the length of a half-by but is deeper.

These cases can be any height, the name only refers to their width and depth.

## Power Distro (PD)

A power distro connects to a wall disconnect and takes and distributes power to many locations. Some of our PDs can send just 208V while others can send both 120V and 208V. PD’s receive power through cams and can output power through soca, L6-20, powercon, Edison, or other connector types. Each area of production has their own PD.

## Workbox
The workbox houses small gear we need for events such as tape, batteries, microphones, Comm headsets and beltpacks, ethernet cables, 1/4" cables, headphone extensions, and a first aid kit.

## Network Rack
All of our major systems tie into this network switch. Audio and lighting/video have designated ports on this switch.

## Rigging & Motors
The Rigging case includes gear like steel flex, spansets, shackles, and cheeseboros. 

We have 1/4 ton, 1/2 ton, 1 ton, and 2 ton motors. The larger the weight capacity the bigger the motor.

Some motors use 3 phase power, others use single phase power. These use different motor PDs.

## Rigging Gear
Spansets – used for rigging and cable strain reliefs

Steel flex - spansets with steel inside of them, used for truss slings to rig truss


Shackles – used to connect elements in a rigging system, such as steel flex, steel, and motors together

Cheeseboros – used to connect rigging objects together, such as pipes, truss, and header bars

## Audio Consoles & Stage Racks
We use DigiCo audio consoles in Vines. The consoles are connected via fiber optic cable stored in the DigiCo case. The SD racks are where stage inputs are patched. 

## Monitors
At monitors there is a monitor rack and wireless rack.


## Speakers and Subs Cases
In addition to the PA and subs, these are some of the cases used to wire and power speakers. Each side of the PA has their own cases.

## LED Wall
We have three different video walls: a 7mm blow-through wall, a 3mm wall, and a 3mm that can curve. Cases have colored tape to differentiate between these products.
Each video wall case holds 6 panels. 

## LED Cable & Hardware
LED data is housed in the cable case, as well as bungee cables for securing the wall. The hardware case contains header bars used to hang the wall from truss.

## Lighting and LED Consoles
We use MA Lighting consoles to control lighting and LED wall. These come in a couple sizes.

Our lighting team uses the full-size MA3 and our video team uses a MA2 Lite.

## Lighting Fixtures & Cases
R2s are a small moving wash light.
  
Battens are long static LED lights. 

Strike 4s are an LED 4 cell blinder. 

Titan Tubes are tube shaped lights.
